Declare search list (this list will be heapified)
Declare search set (stores coordinates of the nodes to be searched)
Declare visited set (stores coordinates of nodes visited)
Declare dictionary of nodes #this will contain a key pair value of coordinates to nodes

define function that adds nodes to the dictionary which takes a coordinate as parameter
   if the node is not in the dictionary
    create a key with the coordinate and assign the node object with the same coordinate

add start node to the dictionary
assign 0 as the gscore of the start node
calculate hscore of the start node
calculate fscore of the start node

push the  fscore, hscore and startnode into the heap 
add startnode to the search set 

while the search set is not empty:
    pick the node with lowest f score from the heap and set it as the current node
    remove the current node from the search set
    add the current node to the visited set

    if the current node is equal to the exit node:
      end the algorithm
      retrace the best path from start to exit
    for each nearby cell of the current grid:
        add the neighbour node to the dictionary

        if the neighbour has been visited already:
            continue skip the next line
        calculate tentative g score

        if the tentative g is lower than the g score of the neighbour:
          set the tentative score as the gscore of the neighbour
          calculate the fscore of the neighbour

          if the neighbour is not in the search set:
            add the node to the search set
            add the fscore, hscore and neighbour node to the heap
